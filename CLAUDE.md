# Claude Instructions

## Core Principles
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- When creating a new file or program, add a timestamp to the filename
- Do not run programs on synthetic or subsampled data unless explicitly requested
- ALWAYS make sure new results files can be traced to the program that generated them

## Project-Specific Context
<!-- Add your project-specific instructions here -->

## Commands to Run
<!-- Add any lint/typecheck commands that should be run after code changes -->
<!-- Example: -->
<!-- npm run lint -->
<!-- npm run typecheck -->
